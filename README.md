Task list

TASK 1 :Voice Command Recognition

Problem Statement:

Develop a voice command recognition system that translates 

spoken commands into actionable tasks.

Task 2: Gender and Age Detection with OpenCV

To develop a computer vision application using OpenCV that can accurately 

predict the gender and age of individuals from images or video streams. The 

model should be able to detect faces in the input data, classify gender 

(male or female), and estimate the age range of the person.
Task 3: Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Prediction 

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately 

detect the presence of Parkinson's disease based on certain features 

extracted from biomedical data. Early detection of Parkinson's disease can 

significantly improve patient outcomes and enable timely intervention. The 

project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create a reliable 

and efficient prediction model.
Task 4: Stock Price Prediction

Interns working on cryptocurrency or stock price prediction projects should 

focus on understanding historical market data, employing machine learning 

algorithms for analysis, exploring features like technical indicators and 

sentiment analysis, and considering external factors influencing market 

trends
